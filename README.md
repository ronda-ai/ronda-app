## üöÄ What is Ronda AI?

<br>
<img width="1919" height="919" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/34707d7b-8285-4f18-b2f5-d8b29bc9697c" />
<br>

**Ronda AI** is an open-source pedagogical assistant that uses generative AI to help educators create a more dynamic, inclusive, and personalized learning environment. The application goes beyond simple gamification; it's a tool to understand, support, and empower each student individually and collectively.

The heart of the application is an interactive "wheel," but its true power lies in the layers of intelligence and analysis surrounding it. As a self-hosted tool, it guarantees **total data sovereignty**: your students' information belongs only to you and resides on your own infrastructure.

Built with the latest web technologies like Next.js, Ronda AI is designed from the ground up to be a **potential Progressive Web App (PWA)**. While it is currently a web application, its architecture lays the groundwork to deliver a native app-like experience. This would allow educators to "install" it on their computers, tablets, or phones for quick access and, most importantly, enable **offline functionality**. This offline capability is crucial for classrooms with unstable internet connectivity, ensuring the tool can remain functional and reliable at all times.

## üí° From Raw Data to Actionable Wisdom: The AI Core

Ronda AI is more than just a collection of features; it's an intelligent system designed to act as a true pedagogical co-pilot. At its heart lies a sophisticated architecture built on **Genkit**, Google's open-source framework for building production-ready AI applications. This allows us to orchestrate complex chains of reasoning, which we call "AI Flows."

Here‚Äôs how it works:

1.  **Contextual Anonymization**: When a teacher requests an analysis (like a "Coach Suggestion"), the system gathers all relevant, encrypted data about a student‚Äîtheir performance, fears, observations, and social relationships. This data is then anonymized, replacing real names with aliases like "Student A."

2.  **Structured AI Flows**: The anonymized data is fed into a specific AI Flow. These flows are not simple prompts; they are structured programs that instruct the language model to act as an expert (e.g., a child psychologist or curriculum designer). Using Zod schemas, we force the model to return a predictable, structured JSON object, not just a block of text.

3.  **De-Anonymization & Delivery**: The AI returns a structured analysis based on the anonymous data. Ronda AI then de-anonymizes the response, replacing aliases with the correct names, and presents it to the teacher as a clean, actionable insight.

This process transforms seemingly disconnected data points into profound pedagogical wisdom, democratizing access to expert-level analysis and empowering every educator to provide deeply personalized support, all while ensuring student privacy remains paramount.

## üîê Privacy and Security by Design

The confidentiality and sovereignty of student data are Ronda AI's top priorities.

*   **Data Sovereignty (Self-Hosting)**: Unlike cloud platforms, you control the server. The database, files, and all application logic reside on your own infrastructure (whether on Vercel, a private server, or your local machine). **Your data is never shared with third parties**.

*   **Encryption at Rest**: All sensitive information stored in the database, such as student names, notes, fears, observations, and evaluations, is **encrypted**. This means that even if someone gained unauthorized access to the database files, they could not read your students' personal information.

*   **Anonymization for AI**: When an external language model (like Google's Gemini) needs to be consulted, Ronda AI **does not send real names**. Instead, the application replaces student names with generic, anonymous aliases like "Student A," "Student B," etc. Once the AI returns a response, the application substitutes the aliases back with the real names, ensuring no personally identifiable information leaves your server.

## üåê Localization and Community Translations

To make Ronda AI accessible to educators worldwide, the application has been translated into multiple languages using generative AI. These include English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German, Simplified Chinese, Japanese, Russian, Italian, Polish, Dutch, Korean, Hindi, and Indonesian.

However, AI-generated translations may contain errors or lack the natural, cultural nuance of a native speaker. **We strongly encourage community contributions** to help refine and improve these translations. If you are a native speaker, please consider helping us make Ronda AI a better tool for your community.

[**‚û°Ô∏è Learn how to contribute to translations**](./docs/CONTRIBUTING.md#translations-and-localization)

## ü§ñ Language Models: Gemini (Default), OpenAI, and More

Ronda AI is built to be flexible, supporting multiple generative AI models.

*   **Google Gemini (Default & Recommended)**: The application is optimized to use Google's **Gemini** models out of the box, offering a powerful and cost-effective solution. You can start for free with the Google AI Studio free tier.

*   **OpenAI, Grok, DeepSeek, and Ollama**: Ronda AI also supports other popular models. You can easily switch to **OpenAI** (e.g., GPT-4o), **xAI** (Grok), or **DeepSeek** by providing the corresponding API key. Additionally, you can connect to any locally-run model through **Ollama**.

[**‚û°Ô∏è See the full guide on configuring Language Models**](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#configuring-the-language-model-llm)

## üóÑÔ∏è Database: MongoDB (Default) & Supabase (Experimental)

Ronda AI offers flexibility in its data backend, supporting both MongoDB and Supabase.

*   **MongoDB (Default)**: The primary and recommended database is **MongoDB**, a NoSQL database. Its flexible, document-based model is ideal for the evolving and complex data structures of a pedagogical tool, allowing for rich student profiles and nested data without rigid schemas. The application is fully optimized for MongoDB.

*   **MongoDB Atlas Vector Search (Required for MBE Expert)**: The "MBE Expert" feature in the Teacher Lab requires a MongoDB Atlas Search Index to perform vector-based similarity searches on the MBE document. This feature is only available on MongoDB's cloud service, Atlas, and will not work on local or self-hosted MongoDB instances. See the [**deployment guide**](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#setting-up-the-vector-search-index-for-mbe-expert) for mandatory setup instructions.

*   **Supabase (Experimental)**: We are actively developing support for **Supabase**, an open-source alternative to Firebase that uses a PostgreSQL relational database. This option is for developers who prefer a SQL-based structure. Please note that **Supabase integration is not yet complete and should be considered experimental.**

## üìú Disclaimer and Notice of Responsibility

Ronda AI is provided as open-source, self-hosted software. This means you have full control over your data, but also full responsibility for its security. While the app includes strong encryption, you are responsible for securing your hosting environment, database, and secret keys. The project creators are not liable for any data breaches resulting from your infrastructure.
