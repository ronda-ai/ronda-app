# üõ°Ô∏è School Safety Lab: Your Command Center for Prevention

The **School Safety Lab** in Ronda AI is a comprehensive module designed to empower educators with the necessary tools for **proactive management of safety and well-being** in the educational environment. This lab goes beyond simple incident reaction; it is a command center for the **diagnosis, planning, training, and organization** of school safety, using artificial intelligence as a powerful ally.

The module is divided into four key phases, each addressing a crucial aspect of a comprehensive safety plan.

### Phase 1: Risk Diagnosis

The first step to effective safety management is understanding the specific vulnerabilities of your educational center. This diagnostic tool uses AI to generate a **preliminary risk map** based on your school's unique context.

*   **Contextual Analysis**: You provide key information in three areas:
    1.  **Location Context**: Is the school in an urban, rural, seismic zone, or near a river?
    2.  **Infrastructure Context**: Is it an old building, does it have several floors, open patios, security bars?
    3.  **Social & Community Context**: Is there a history of conflicts, a good relationship with the police, an active parent community?

*   **AI-Generated Risk Map**: Based on your descriptions, the AI generates a structured report that identifies and prioritizes potential risks, categorizing them into:
    *   **Natural Risks** (e.g., earthquakes, floods).
    *   **Social Risks** (e.g., bullying, community conflicts).
    *   **Infrastructure Risks** (e.g., obsolete electrical systems, structural problems).

    Each risk is accompanied by a **priority (High, Medium, Low)** and a justification, giving you a clear and professional starting point to focus your efforts.

### Phase 2: Action Protocols

Once the risks are identified, the next step is to create clear and concise plans. The protocol generator helps you transform a risk into a **detailed and easy-to-follow action plan**.

*   **Simple Input**: You simply specify the risk for which you need a protocol (e.g., "Fire," "Earthquake," "Case of cyberbullying").

*   **Structured Protocol**: The AI generates a complete document with three critical sections:
    1.  **Before the Event (Prevention)**: Proactive and educational steps to reduce the likelihood or impact of the risk.
    2.  **During the Event (Action)**: Clear, direct, and simple instructions on what to do at the moment of the crisis.
    3.  **After the Event (Recovery)**: Steps for recovery, follow-up, and post-incident learning.

### Phase 3: Crisis Simulation

Planning is crucial, but practice is what saves lives. The crisis simulation tool allows you to **train your decision-making skills** in a safe and controlled environment.

*   **Scenario Setup**:
    *   **Type of Crisis**: Define the scenario you want to practice (e.g., "Earthquake," "Active intruder").
    *   **Simulation Length**: Choose between a short (~5 turns), medium (~10 turns), or complex (~15 turns) drill.
    *   **Participants (Optional)**: You can include specific students in the scenario. The AI will use their profiles (e.g., a student with a fear of enclosed spaces) to make the simulation more realistic and challenging.

*   **Interactive Simulation**:
    1.  The AI presents an initial situation.
    2.  You choose one of the possible actions.
    3.  The AI **evaluates your decision** (good, average, bad), gives you **constructive feedback**, and adjusts your **score**.
    4.  The narrative advances, showing the consequences of your choice. The scenario can improve or worsen, always offering an opportunity to remedy the situation.
    5.  At the end of the simulation, the AI provides a **summary of your performance** and key takeaways.

### Phase 4: Safety Committees

Safety is a shared responsibility. This tool helps you organize and manage **safety brigades or committees**, assigning roles and responsibilities to students and staff.

*   **Committee Creation**: Easily create different brigades with specific names (e.g., "First Aid Brigade," "Evacuation Committee").
*   **Member Management**: Add or remove students from each committee simply.
*   **Organization and Delegation**: Use these groups to assign specific tasks from the action protocols, fostering a culture of safety throughout the school community.
