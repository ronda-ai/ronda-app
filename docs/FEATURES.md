# Detailed Feature Description

Ronda AI is a robust pedagogical assistant designed to transform the classroom. Below is a detailed description of each of its main features, from boosting participation to generating complex pedagogical tools with AI.

## üé° Intelligent Participation Wheel

The core of Ronda AI is its student selection system, which offers multiple modes to adapt to different pedagogical objectives.

*   **Random Mode**: The classic and fair selection for equitable participation.
*   **AI-Weighted Mode**: Analyzes participation history and gives a higher probability of being selected to students who have spoken the least, promoting an inclusive environment.
*   **Dynamic Duo Mode**: Automatically selects two students to collaborate, fostering teamwork.
*   **Custom Manual Mode**: Allows the teacher to manually select a student or group (up to 3) to assign them a specific challenge, taking into account their individual profiles.

## üß† AI Pedagogical Coach

A set of analysis and generation tools to support the educator in decision-making and individualized support.

*   **Coach Suggestion**: Generates a concise analysis of a student's profile, highlighting positive aspects, areas for improvement, and a concrete pedagogical suggestion, along with a reflection question for the teacher.
*   **Concern Analysis**: The AI reviews a student's complete history (grades, moods, observations) to identify recurring patterns of concern and offer a constructive interpretation.
*   **Personalized Support Plans**: Creates multi-step action plans, based on the student's history and feedback from previous plans, to address specific needs such as shyness, lack of confidence, or academic difficulties.
*   **Fear Management**: Generates empathetic and creative strategies to help students manage and overcome their fears in a safe environment, proposing specific activities.
*   **Student Profile Suggestions**: The AI can suggest new qualities, fears, or notes to add to a student's profile based on their performance or provided information.
*   **Consult the AI Expert**: Allows the teacher to ask an open-ended question about a specific student to receive detailed pedagogical or psychological guidance, based on the full context of the student's profile.

## üî¨ Social Dynamics Lab

Tools focused on visualizing, understanding, and acting upon the social fabric of the classroom.

*   **Relationship Remediation**: Generates specific intervention plans to improve conflicted relationships between two or more students, proposing activities designed to foster empathy and collaboration.
*   **Relationship Focus Suggestion**: The AI analyzes the general state of relationships in the classroom and suggests which pair or group could most benefit from an intervention, proposing a focus and a "custom prompt" for the activity.
*   **Individual Integration Strategy**: Creates an action plan to help a student with social integration difficulties, focusing on skills like initiating conversations or finding common interests.

## üéì PBL Lab: Your Project-Based Learning Co-Pilot

Ronda AI features a dedicated **PBL Lab**, a powerful module designed to guide educators and students through the entire lifecycle of a Project-Based Learning (PBL) project. The lab streamlines planning, team formation, and evaluation, turning complex projects into manageable, engaging experiences.

## üõ°Ô∏è School Safety Lab: Your Command Center for Prevention

Ronda AI includes a dedicated **School Safety Lab**, a comprehensive module for the **proactive management of safety and well-being** in the educational environment. It goes beyond simple incident reaction; it's a command center for diagnosis, planning, training, and organization of school safety.

*   **Risk Diagnosis**: Provide context about your school's location, infrastructure, and social dynamics to generate an AI-prioritized **risk map**.
*   **Action Protocols**: Create **step-by-step action plans** (Before, During, and After) for specific risks like earthquakes, fires, or bullying.
*   **Crisis Simulation**: Train your decision-making skills in an **interactive crisis simulator**. Define a scenario, include students for realism, and navigate the situation while receiving feedback and a score.
*   **Safety Committees**: Organize your students and staff into **safety brigades**, such as "First Aid" or "Evacuation," to assign clear roles and responsibilities.

## üí° Teacher Lab: Your Private Space for Professional Growth

Ronda AI introduces the **Teacher Lab**, a private module designed to be a personal AI assistant for professional development. This space, explicitly linked to the Chilean **"Marco para la Buena Ense√±anza" (MBE)**, offers tools for self-evaluation, planning, and reflective practice.

*   **Classroom Pulse**: Get an AI-generated summary of your class's current strengths and challenges, tagged with relevant MBE criteria.
*   **Planning Co-pilot**: Describe a learning objective and receive a "pedagogical menu" with three different class plans, each justified with MBE criteria.
*   **Classroom Climate Simulator**: Practice handling common classroom management situations in a safe, interactive simulation that provides feedback based on the MBE.
*   **MBE Expert**: Ask any question about the "Marco para la Buena Ense√±anza" and get an answer generated by an AI expert that has studied the official document.
*   **Guided Reflection Assistant**: Engage in a Socratic dialogue with an AI coach. Write your thoughts on a class, and the AI will ask insightful questions to deepen your reflection, always connecting back to the MBE framework.

## üé® Pedagogical Tool Generator

Save planning time and create high-quality materials instantly.

*   **Curriculum Activity Generator**: On any topic and for any level, generates 3 varied activities (individual, pair, group) focused on developing specific skills.
*   **Personalized Activity Generator**: Creates a unique activity plan for a student, based on their interests, qualities, and needs (dyslexia, ADHD, etc.).
*   **Activity Adapter (Resource Democratizer)**: Paste the text of any existing activity, and the AI will offer adaptations for different contexts: using homemade materials, for low-energy students, to increase social interaction, or to simplify instructions.
*   **Rubric Generator**: Describe an activity or exam and get a detailed evaluation rubric, including performance criteria (excellent, satisfactory, needs improvement) and a scoring guide.
*   **Test Generator**: Transforms any topic or the full content of a collaborative story into a complete test. The generated tests are fully editable, can be administered live in the classroom, or downloaded for offline use.

## üåê Inclusive Language Support

Creates a bridge for students who are learning the main language of instruction.

*   **Bilingual Material Generation**: Generates a guide for the teacher (in the language of instruction) and material for the student (in their native language) on a specific focus area (reading, writing, etc.).
*   **Audio Support (Text-to-Speech)**: Automatically converts the student's material into an audio file in their native language to support listening comprehension and pronunciation.

## üõ°Ô∏è Digital Citizenship Tools

A set of features to foster positive and responsible online behavior.

*   **Digital Citizenship Activities**: Generates interactive dynamics, such as "netiquette challenges" with hypothetical situations, digital collaboration micro-games, or exercises for rephrasing messages positively.
*   **Conflict Simulation**: Prepares teachers for at-risk situations by generating digital conflict scenarios (e.g., cyberbullying, misinformation). The system suggests intervention strategies and shows the possible simulated outcomes of each decision.
*   **Digital Conviviality Pact**: The AI generates a draft of a "conviviality agreement" for the class, including principles (respect, empathy), specific norms, and a system of restorative consequences, encouraging it to be a negotiable document agreed upon by the students.

## üïπÔ∏è AI Games Playground

Introduce an element of intelligent gamification into the classroom.

*   **Lightning Round**: A quick game mode that throws micro-challenges (gestures, sounds, imitations) at randomly selected students in short intervals to energize the class.
