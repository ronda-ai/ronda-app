# ðŸŽ“ PBL Lab: Your Project-Based Learning Co-Pilot

Ronda AI's **Project-Based Learning (PBL) Lab** is a powerful module designed to guide educators and students through the entire lifecycle of a project. From idea conception to final evaluation, the lab streamlines planning, team formation, and scaffolding, turning complex projects into manageable, engaging experiences.

The module is structured into four key phases, each with specific AI tools to support both the teacher and the learners.

---

### Phase 1: Project Planning

The goal of this phase is to transform a simple idea or curriculum topic into a structured, comprehensive project plan.

*   **Tool: "Complex Project Generator"**
    *   **Teacher's Input:** Provide a central theme (e.g., "Climate change in our city"), key skills to develop (e.g., "research," "visual communication," "teamwork"), and an estimated project duration.
    *   **AI's Output:** The AI generates a comprehensive project document that includes:
        *   **Essential Question:** An open-ended, provocative guiding question designed to drive student inquiry and critical thinking (e.g., "How can we, as young citizens, reduce our school's carbon footprint by 10%?").
        *   **Project Phases:** A logical breakdown of the work into sequential stages, providing a clear roadmap (e.g., Week 1: Research & Data Collection; Week 2: Solution Creation & Prototyping; Week 3: Final Preparation & Presentation).
        *   **Key Milestones:** Specific, measurable checkpoints to assess progress throughout the project (e.g., "Submit initial research report," "Present prototype of the solution," "Final draft of presentation script").
        *   **Final Product Suggestions:** Creative, tangible ideas for the project's outcome, allowing students to demonstrate their learning in diverse ways (e.g., "A school awareness campaign with posters and videos," "A working prototype of an improved recycling system," "A documentary-style podcast interviewing local experts").

### Phase 2: Strategic Team Formation

This phase uses Ronda AI's social data and AI to create workgroups that are not only functional but also meet specific pedagogical and social objectives.

*   **Tool: "Strategic Team Former"**
    *   **Teacher's Input:** Choose the project, set the team size, and most importantly, select an AI-assisted **grouping criterion**:
        *   **"Balanced Teams":** The AI mixes students with different strengths (e.g., a leader, a creative thinker, an organizer) to create a synergistic and well-rounded group.
        *   **"Social Remediation":** The AI identifies students with tense relationships and deliberately pairs them in a low-pressure project context, designed to foster collaboration and mend social dynamics.
        *   **"Interest Synergy":** The AI groups students with similar interests and passions to maximize engagement and intrinsic motivation in the project.
    *   **AI's Output:**
        *   **Suggested Teams:** Lists of students for each team, optimized according to the selected criterion.
        *   **Suggested Roles and Justification:** Within each team, the AI assigns project-specific roles (e.g., "Project Manager," "Lead Researcher," "Creative Director," "Communications Officer") based on each student's qualities and history. It also provides a clear justification for each assignment, explaining why that role is a good fit for that student.

### Phase 3: On-the-Fly Scaffolding

During project development, it's common for teams to encounter obstacles. This phase provides the teacher with AI tools to intervene effectively without directly giving away the solution.

*   **Tool: "On-the-Fly Scaffolding Generator"**
    *   **Teacher's Input:** Select a team and describe a specific problem they are facing (e.g., "The team is stuck in the research phase and doesn't know where to start," "One student is dominating the conversation, and others are not participating," "The team has lost motivation").
    *   **AI's Output:** A quick and practical mini-intervention plan:
        *   **Micro-Activity:** A short, focused activity (5-15 minutes) designed to unblock the team (e.g., "A 'Round Robin' structured brainstorming session," "A 5-minute role-reassignment exercise to redistribute responsibilities," "An 'empathy map' activity to better understand their project's users").
        *   **Guiding Questions:** A list of 2-3 open-ended, Socratic questions the teacher can ask the team to encourage reflection, metacognition, and autonomy, guiding them toward their own solution.

### Phase 4: Objective Evaluation

The final phase focuses on a fair and comprehensive assessment of both the final product and the teamwork process.

*   **Tool: "360Â° Project Evaluator"**
    *   **Teacher's Input:** Select the completed project. The AI already knows the objectives, skills, and final product defined in Phase 1.
    *   **AI's Output:** A detailed and customizable **evaluation rubric**. The rubric includes clear criteria for assessing both the quality of the **final product** (e.g., "Depth of research," "Clarity of communication," "Creativity of solution") and the effectiveness of the **teamwork process** (e.g., "Collaboration and roles," "Conflict resolution," "Time management"). Each criterion comes with descriptors for different performance levels (e.g., Excellent, Satisfactory, Needs Improvement).
