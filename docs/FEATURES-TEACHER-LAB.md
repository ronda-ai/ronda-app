# ðŸ’¡ Teacher Lab: A Space for Reflective Practice

The **Teacher Lab** is your personal pedagogical assistant, a private space designed for professional self-development, guided by artificial intelligence. Unlike other modules focused on the student, this lab centers on you, the educator, and is deeply integrated with the Chilean **"Marco para la Buena EnseÃ±anza" (MBE)** to provide a robust and relevant pedagogical framework.

The lab is organized into tabs that align with the MBE domains, offering specific tools for each area.

**NOTE:** The "MBE Expert" functionality within this lab requires the use of MongoDB Atlas (MongoDB's cloud service) and a specific Vector Search Index configuration. It will not work with local or self-hosted MongoDB instances. Please see the [**deployment guide**](./DEPLOYMENT.md#setting-up-the-vector-search-index-for-mbe-expert) for mandatory setup instructions.

### Tab 1: Classroom Pulse (General Overview)

This is your 360-degree view of the classroom. With a single click, the AI analyzes key data from all your studentsâ€”such as relationships, recent participation, and moodsâ€”to generate a concise summary of the classroom's overall health.

*   **Group Strengths**: Identifies positive trends (e.g., "Most students show high collaboration in 'Power Duo' challenges") and links them to MBE criteria like **B1 (Creates a climate of respectful relationships)**.
*   **Potential Challenges**: Detects possible issues (e.g., "There is a recurring conflict between Student A and Student C that could affect teamwork") and connects it to criteria like **A2 (Knows the characteristics, interests, and experiences of their students)**.

### Tab 2: Domain A - Planning

This tab helps you design more effective and varied lessons, turning a simple objective into multiple pedagogical action plans.

*   **Tool: "Planning Co-pilot"**
    *   **Teacher's Input:** You write a clear learning objective (e.g., "For students to understand the water cycle").
    *   **AI's Output:** The AI returns a **"Pedagogical Menu"** with three distinct class approaches to achieve the same objective. Each approach includes:
        1.  **Creative Title**: e.g., "Climate Reporters," "A Water Droplet's Journey," "Condensation Lab."
        2.  **Sequenced Activities**: A three-step plan (Start, Development, Closure) for each approach.
        3.  **MBE Justification**: A brief explanation of why that approach is pedagogically sound, citing specific MBE criteria (e.g., "This approach promotes critical thinking (C8) and collaboration (B1)").
        4.  **Adaptation Suggestion**: A practical tip on how to adapt one of the activities for a student with specific needs, based on the anonymous profiles of your class.

### Tab 3: Domain B & C - Environment and Teaching

Here you can practice and hone your classroom management skills and teaching strategies in a safe, controlled environment.

*   **Tool: "Classroom Climate Simulator"**
    *   **Teacher's Input:** You describe a classroom management situation you'd like to practice (e.g., "Two students are arguing and not working," "A student is completely disengaged from the activity"). You can also define the simulation's length (short, medium, or long).
    *   **Interactive Simulation:**
        1.  The AI presents the initial scenario.
        2.  It offers you 2-4 concrete intervention choices.
        3.  After your choice, the AI **evaluates your decision** based on the MBE (e.g., "Good choice. By quietly approaching, you maintain the flow of the class (C4) and manage coexistence respectfully (B3).") and the narrative advances, showing the consequences of your action.
        4.  The cycle repeats, creating a branching, realistic scenario.

*   **Tool: "Question Quality Analyzer"**
    *   **Teacher's Input:** You paste a list of questions you asked or plan to ask.
    *   **AI's Output:** The AI analyzes each question and:
        1.  Classifies it according to **Bloom's Taxonomy** (Remembering, Understanding, Applying, Analyzing, Evaluating, Creating).
        2.  Provides a justification for why it belongs to that level.
        3.  Offers a **concrete suggestion to elevate it** to a higher cognitive level.
        4.  Delivers an overall summary of the cognitive quality of your question set.

### Tab 4: Domain D - Professional Reflection

This is your most personal space: an interactive professional journal and a hub for sharing learnings.

*   **Tool: "MBE Expert"**
    *   **Teacher's Input**: Ask any open-ended question about the "Marco para la Buena EnseÃ±anza," optionally providing context about a specific student.
    *   **AI's Output**: An expert answer generated by an AI that has studied the official MBE document, providing detailed, practical, and well-founded guidance tailored to your query.

*   **Tool: "Guided Reflection Assistant"**
    *   **Teacher's Input:** You freely write your thoughts, frustrations, or successes about a class.
    *   **AI's Output (Socratic Dialogue):** The AI doesn't give answers but **asks follow-up questions** designed to deepen your reflection, always anchored in the MBE. (e.g., "I understand. You mention they were bored. Thinking about Domain A, how do you think the initial activity connected with their interests (A2)?").

*   **Tool: "Peer Collaboration"**
    *   **Teacher's Input:** With a single click, you can export the results from any of the lab's tools (the Pedagogical Menu, the Question Analysis, or your reflection dialogue) in a clean, well-structured format.
    *   **Output:** An HTML document ready to print or share with your colleagues, facilitating professional development conversations and collective learning.
